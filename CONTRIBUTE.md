# Contributing to PSKeePass

## Considerations

1. Only fork the dev branch.
2. Pull requests to master will not be considered.
3. Include comments on your code.
4. Keep comments up to date.
5. Create issues for any code corrections on the dev branch, fork then pull.
6. Use Allman Style indentation or similar for code style. (At least be consistent.)
7. Ask questions.

## Needs Help

If you would like to contribute it would be great if you could focus on:

1. Exception/Error Handling
2. Module Help and Documentation
3. Pester-Tests to easily test PSKeePass against new versions of the KeePass SDK, changes and additions
