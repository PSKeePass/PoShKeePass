# PSKeePass
PowerShell module for KeePass
This Module is based on the work of Jason Fossen at Sans.org (https://cyber-defense.sans.org/blog/2015/08/13/powershell-for-keepass-sample-script)

It´s intent is to make the usage of KeePass as a credential database inside PowerShell scripts as easy
as possible. Please be aware that you should use SecureStrngs, PSCredential objects and Event-Log encryption to keep you secrets save.

The module contains the following functions:

Set-KeePassConfiguration
Get-KeePassConfiguration
Get-KeePassEntry
Set-KeePassEntry
New-KeePassEntry

The module currently has nearly no error-handling!
